# For the search(BroweBy...) function, it is case sensitive, and in the database, the first letter is capitalized. So for Browsebytype, 'Drink' would work but 'dirnk' would not work.
# User can add order by typing in the ItemName and amount of Item he/she wants, program will keep on prompting user until user type "no" on ordering. After user type 'no' Order will be placed and orderid will show up. User need to remember his/her orderid to Update order or view order Status.
